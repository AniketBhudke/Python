# Basic String Operations:
# Create a string variable with the value "Python Programming" and print the length of the string.
# Extract the word "Python" from the string "Python Programming".
# Concatenate the two strings "Hello" and "World" with a space in between.
# Check if the substring "code" exists in the string "coding is fun".
# Convert the string "hello" to uppercase and "WORLD" to lowercase.
# String Slicing and Indexing:
# Given the string "Python", extract the first and last characters.
# Reverse the string "programming" without using any built-in functions.
# Using slicing, extract every second character from the string "abcdefghij".
# Write a program that prints the string "hello" without the first and last character.
# Create a program that extracts the last 4 characters of a string.
# String Methods:
# Write a program to count how many times the letter "e" appears in the string "experience".
# Given the string "apple, banana, cherry", split it into a list of words.
# Join a list of words ["this", "is", "a", "sentence"] into a single string with spaces.
# Write a program to replace the word "blue" with "green" in the string "The sky is blue".
# Check if the string "12345" consists only of digits.
# String Formatting:
# Write a program that takes the variables name = "Alice" and age = 30 and prints "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old" using string formatting.
# Format the string "The price is {} dollars" by inserting the price 49.99.
# Write a program that formats the string "{} is {} years old" to print "Bob is 25 years old".
# Using f-strings, write a program to display the result of 5 * 3 = 15.
# Create a program that formats a floating-point number to two decimal places (e.g., 123.456 becomes 123.46).
# String Problem-Solving:
# Write a Python program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.
# Check if the string "madam" is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
# Given a string "The quick brown fox", write a program that counts how many words start with the letter "t" (case-insensitive).
# Write a Python program that removes all the spaces from a given string.
# Create a function that takes a string and returns the string with its words in reverse order (e.g., "hello world" becomes "world hello").
# String Manipulation:
# Write a Python program to remove the first and last occurrence of a specific character from a string.
# Given a string "hello world", capitalize the first letter of each word.
# Write a program that removes all punctuation from the string "Hello! How are you doing? I'm fine, thanks.".
# Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed.
# Given a string "banana", write a program to find the first and last occurrence of the letter "a".
# Advanced String Practice:
# Write a program that takes two strings and returns True if they are anagrams (contain the same characters in a different order).
