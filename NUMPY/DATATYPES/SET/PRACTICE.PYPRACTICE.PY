# Basic Set Operations:
# Create a set with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4. Add an element 5 to the set.
# set1={1,2,3,4}
# set1.add(5)
# print(set1)

# Remove an element from a set using the remove() method, and then try removing an element that does not exist using discard(). Explain the difference between the two methods.
# set1={1,11,12,13,14,15}
# set1.remove(11)
# print(set1)

# set2={12,13,14}
# set2.discard(111)
# print(set2)

# Check if the element 3 exists in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
# set1= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# print( 3 in set1)

# Find the length of a set s = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
# s = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# print(len(s))

# s = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# count=0
# for i in s:
#     print(i)
#     count=count+1
# print(count)

# Set Methods:
# Write a program to find the union of two sets: {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5}.
# set1={3, 4, 5}
# set2= {1, 2, 3} 
# print(set1.union(set2))

# Find the intersection of two sets: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}.

# Write a program that finds the difference between two sets: {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6} (i.e., elements in the first set that are not in the second).
# Given two sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5, 6}, find the symmetric difference between the two sets (i.e., elements that are in either set but not both).
# Clear all elements from a set.
# Set Operations:
# Write a program that checks whether one set is a subset of another (e.g., {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}).
# Given two sets {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5}, check if they are disjoint (i.e., they have no elements in common).
# Create a set of numbers from 1 to 10, then remove all even numbers from the set.
# Write a program that finds the common elements between three sets: {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, and {3, 4, 5}.
# Find the smallest and largest element in a set of numbers {10, 5, 20, 15}.
# Set and Functions:
# Write a function that takes two sets and returns their union.
# Write a function that takes two sets and returns their intersection.
# Write a function that takes a set and a list, and returns a set of elements that are common between them.
# Create a function that takes a set and removes all elements that are less than 10.
# Write a function that returns the unique elements from a list by converting it to a set.
# Set Manipulation:
# Write a program that adds all the elements of a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to a set.
# Given a set of words, write a program that returns a new set with only the words that contain more than 3 letters.
# Create a set from the string "abracadabra", then remove all vowels from the set.
# Write a program that finds all unique elements from two lists [1, 2, 2, 3, 4] and [2, 3, 5, 6] using sets.
# Given a set of integers, create a new set with the squares of the original elements.
# Set Problem-Solving:
# Write a Python program to find all the elements that are in a list but not in a given set.
# Write a Python program that finds the difference between two sets, but only if the result is non-empty.
# Create two sets of random integers, then write a program that finds the unique elements present in either set but not both.
# Given a list of numbers, write a program that returns True if all elements in the list are unique, using sets.
# Write a program to merge two sets and sort the resulting set in ascending order.12w
